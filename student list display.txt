Class this method will be in: University

Steps:
1. Make private attribute of ArrayList<Student> allStudents = new ArrayList<Student>
    - Private as we do not want other classes to be able to access or modify the list of all the students
2. Make getStudentArray() method in the Unit Class that returns the enrolledStudents array
3. nested loop: Loop through the units (allUnits.get(i)), loop through the studentArray of each unit
4. If statement using ArrayList.contains() method, if false, add to all allStudents
5. return allStudents after the end of the nested loop.
